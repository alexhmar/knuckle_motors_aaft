        <p className="info">
          When the redesigned Fat Bob premiered in the fall of 2017, it was the
          breakout star of Harley-Davidson's new lineup of motorcycles. Its
          tough street style, with matte paint, rectangular LED headlamp, fat
          tires, and stubby fenders, resonated with everyone from millennials to
          baby boomers, from zealots to newbies. At the bike's debut, the
          heritage brand had just announced that it was altogether discontinuing
          its coveted Dyna platform and, of course, purists were pissed. But
          this badass Fat Bob (almost) single handedly muted the cries of
          heresy. There was no denying it: This bike is cool.
